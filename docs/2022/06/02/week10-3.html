      <p><em>Encoding and data interaction in graphs</em></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>These notes continue our tour of graph interactivity. We’ll explore
how certain graph queries can be more easily answered by allowing
users to modify visual encodings (Encoding Interactivity) and the
form of the data that are displayed (Data Interactivity).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let’s begin with encoding interactivity. One simple example of this
type of interactivity is highlighting. This changes the visual
appearance of different nodes or edges based on user interest. For
example, in either node link or adjacency matrix views, we can
highlight one-step neighborhoods based on the position of the user’s
mouse. For example, here is an example for node-link views,</p>

    <iframe src="https://krisrs1128.github.io/stat679_code/examples/week10/week10-1/highschool-hover.html" data-external="1" height="450" width="600"></iframe>

    <p>and here is one for adjacency matrix views,</p>

    <iframe src="https://krisrs1128.github.io/stat679_code/examples/week10/week10-1/miserables-adj-neighbors.html" data-external="1" height="450" width="600"></iframe>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In both of these examples, we first build a data structure
containing the neighbors of each node in the graph. For example the
array following <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0:</code> gives the indices of all nodes that are
neighbors with node <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code>,</p>

    <p><img src="/stat679_notes/assets/week10-1/neighbors-js.png" width="350" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>

    <p>Once we have this data structure, we can quickly look up neighbors
every time we hover over a node (or matrix tile in the adjacency
matrix view). We then update the graphical marks to reflect these
neighborhoods. In the node-link view, we highlight the neighbors in
red using the following update,</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>d3.select("#nodes")
  .selectAll("circle")
  .attrs({
    fill: d =&gt; neighbors[ix].indexOf(d.index) == -1 ? "black" : "red"
  })
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>and similarly, for the adjacency matrix visualization, we change the
x-label font size and opacity using this so that only the neighbors
are visible,</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>d3.select("#xlabels")
  .selectAll("text")
  .attrs({
"font-size": d =&gt; d.index == target? 14 : 10,
"opacity": d =&gt; neighbors[source].indexOf(d.index) == -1? 0 : 1
  })
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Conceptually, there is nothing unique about this interactivity code,
compared to what we already have used for more basic plots (e.g.,
for scatterplots), and many of the techniques we learned earlier
apply here. For example, if want to allow the user to select a node
without placing their mouse directly over it, we can adapt the
Delaunay lookups that we have <a href="https://krisrs1128.github.io/stat679_notes/2022/06/01/week6-3.html">previously
used</a>
in scatterplot interaction. Here is an implementation of this idea
by Alex Macy,</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Brushing and linking is often used for encoding interactivity.
Properly coordinated views can be used to highlight nodes or edges
with a particular property. For example, suppose we wanted to a
simple way of highlighting all the hubs in a network (i.e., nodes
with many neighbors). One idea is to link a histogram of node
degrees with the actual node-link diagram. In principle, we could
modify a variety of node and edge attributes based on user
interactions (size, color, line type, …). However, it’s usually</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Next, let’s consider data interactions. Two common types of data
interactions are user-guided filtering and aggregation. In
filtering, we remove data from view — this can be determined by UI
inputs, dynamic queries, or direct manipulation of marks on the
screen.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, in the example below, we filter edges based on their
edge-betweeness-centrality (a measure of how many paths go through
that edge). This is helpful for isolating the “backbone” of the
network.</p>

    <iframe src="https://krisrs1128.github.io/stat679_code/examples/week10/week10-3/interactome-2.html" data-external="1" height="450" width="600"></iframe>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To implement this view, we use the standard enter-update-exit
pattern. We had precomputed the edge centralities in advance, so
updating the displayed marks is simply a matter of determining which
edge array elements to bind.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pruning reduces the number of marks on the display by removing some.
In contrast, aggregation reduces the number of marks by collapsing
many into a few. One approach to aggregation is to clump tightly
connected clusters of nodes into metanodes. This is a special case
of “semantic zooming” — instead of simply resizing a static
collection of elements, semantic zooming modifies the elements that
are shown so that additional details are shown on demand.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, a semantic zoom with two zoom levels would allow the
user to collapse and expand metanodes based on user interest. Here
is an implementation by @rymarchikbot. The construction of the
enclosing paths is similar to our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">convex_hull</code>-based compound graph
visualization from the first set of notes for this week.</p>

    <iframe width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0" src="https://observablehq.com/embed/@rymarchikbot/d3-js-force-layout-click-to-group-bundle-nodes?cell=*"></iframe>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both filtering and aggregation work by refocusing our attention on
graph structures, either from the top down (removing less
interesting elements) or from the bottom up (combining similar
ones). An intermediate strategy is based on graph navigation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main idea of graph navigation is to start zoomed in, with only a
small part of the graph visible. Then, based on user interest, we
can visually signal those directions of the graph that are
especially worth moving towards. Concretely, it is possible to
define a degree-of-interest function across the collection of nodes,
as formalized by <a href="https://dig.cmu.edu/publications/2009-doigraphs.html">(Van Ham and Perer
2009)</a>. This
function can update based on user inputs. The encoding of the graph
can then be modified to suggest that certain regions be focused in
on.</p>

    <p><img src="/stat679_notes/assets/week10-1/2009-doigraphs.png" width="350" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Note that this is different from the overview-plus-detail principle
that we have used in many places. It is helpful when attempting to
overview the entire network may not be necessary and exploring local
neighborhoods is enough to answer most questions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Together, view, encoding, and data interaction provide a rich set of
techniques for exploring graph data. Moreover, many of the
techniques we described here are still areas of active research, and
perhaps in the future, it will be easier to design and implement
graph interactions suited to specific problems of interest.</p>
