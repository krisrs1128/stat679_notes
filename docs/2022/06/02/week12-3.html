<ol>
  <li>
    <p>For most of the course, we have focused on visualizing the data
directly. For the last few weeks, though, we have visualized the
results of an initial modeling step, like fitting PCA or topic
models. These kinds of models can help in creating abstractions, and
reasoning effectively through abstraction is often a source of
discovery.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ideal is to apply modeling to lift concrete datasets into more
meaningful abstractions, which can then be visualized to support
high-level reasoning. Reality, however, is rarely as simple is that.
In practice, models can go awry, visualizations can be misleading,
and results can be misunderstood. Indeed, this complexity is one of
the reasons data science training takes years.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The authors of this week’s reading suggest a mnemonic: “interpret
but verify.” This captures several principles,</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Interpret: Models and visualizations should be designed in such
a way that users can draw inferences that are relevant to their
understanding of a domain.</li>
      <li>Verify: It is the designer’s responsibility that these
inferences be accurate.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="stanford-dissertation-browser">Stanford Dissertation Browser</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The authors ground their discussion by considering a specific design
project: The Stanford Dissertation Browser. For this project,
university leadership wanted to discover ways to promote effective,
interdisciplinary research. Topic models helped transform the the
raw dissertation text data into higher-levels of abstraction.
Research themes were reflected in topics, and the interdisciplinary
reach of certain PhD theses was reflected in their
mixed-memberships.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In several initial implementations of their interface, it was easy
to draw incorrect inferences. For example, in some
dimensionality-reduction outputs, it seemed that petroleum
engineering had become closer to biology over time, but this turned
out to be an artifact of the reduction and was not visible when
using the original distances. Another example — some words were used
in neurobiology (voltage, current, …) led to theses in this
department to appear very close to electrical engineering, when they
really had more in common with those in other biology departments.</p>

</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The authors carefully tracked and manually verified inferences made
by a group of test users. Based on this qualitative evaluation, they
were able to refine their modeling and visualization approach. For
example, they used a supervised variant of topics models, and they
replaced their original dimensionality reduction scatterplot with a
visualization of topic-derived inter-department similarities.</p>

</ol>

<h4 id="overall-strategy">Overall Strategy</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>To implement the “interpret but verify” idea, the authors recommend,</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Align the analysis, visualization, and models along appropriate
“units of analysis.”</li>
      <li>Verify that the modeling results in abstractions / concepts that
are relevant to the analysis, and modify accordingly.</li>
      <li>Progressively disclose data to support reasoning at multiple
levels of abstraction.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The units of analysis in the dissertation browser were departments
and theses. In general, these are the “entities, relationships, and
concepts” of interest, and they can often linked to existing
metadata.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Verification can be guided both by quantitative metrics (e.g., test
error) and qualitative evaluation (e.g., user studies). For revising
models, it can be possible to refit parameters, add labels, modify
model structure, or simply override the model with user-provided
values.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Progressive disclosure allows the user to go up and down the <a href="http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/">ladder
of abstraction</a>. It
makes it possible to navigate large-scale data while supporting
verification through specific examples.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the dissertation browser, this is implemented through semantic
zooming (from departmental to dissertation views) and linked
highlighting (revealing the dissertation abstract on mouseover).</p>

    <p>The question of how to effectively weave together model building
with visual design is still one that is actively explored in
research today. If you enjoyed reading about this project, you may
