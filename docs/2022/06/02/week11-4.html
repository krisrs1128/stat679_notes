      <p><em>Guiding dimensionality reduction through user inputs</em></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>In the academic literature, dimensionality reduction methods are
presented purely algorithmically. However, in practice, there is
often a strong human element in the application of these methods,
since their value is often in the qualitative interpretations that
they support.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With this in mind, we should try to understand how interactivity can
be used in the dimensionality reduction context. Naturally, all of
the techniques we’ve studied in this class for interacting with
scatterplots (e.g., dynamic linking) apply to dimensionality
reduction results.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, below, we give details about each sample that is
selected, sorted from those with the smallest to largest values of
PC 1.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A less obvious idea is that interactivity can guide the application
or refinement of the dimensionality reduction itself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, it can be used to filter the data that are input to the
dimensionality reduction. More generally, the input data may be the
result of a complex preprocessing pipeline, and parameters of that
pipeline can be interactively adjusted. For example, in
dimensionality reduction of temporal data, we may first want to
compute a sliding window average over time, and the widths of the
windows can be chosen interactively. For each choice of window
width, the dimensionality reduction scatterplot can be regenerated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some systems allow users to interactively label observations into
classes — this is especially common when the ultimate goal of the
data science system is to support classification. Certain
dimensionality reduction methods (though not the ones we discussed
in class) can incorporate these class labels, and so can be
recomputed each time the user labels a subset of points.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather than interacting with the observations, we can interact with
the features. For example, the PCA loadings define derived features.
By interactively adjusting the values of these loadings, we can
examine how the dimensionality reduction would change when the
derived features are manually refined.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s also possible to interactively select between several competing
dimensionality reduction methods. This is most often done using
together with a measure of dimensionality reduction quality, like
the effectiveness with which known clusters are separated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In most applications, users are expected to interact either directly
with the visualization (selecting or marking points) or via UI
inputs. It’s possible to have the interaction through external
program controls or other more novel inputs (like speech, gestures,
multitouch commands on tablets, …), but this is less commonly done.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Stepping back, it’s helpful to view visualization and data science
algorithms holistically. In applications where interpretation and
discovery are important, algorithms and interaction can work
together to support complex reasoning.</p>
  </li>
