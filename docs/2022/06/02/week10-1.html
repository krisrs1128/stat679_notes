      <p><em>Representing known structure in graphs</em></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Graph layouts can often benefit from additional information known
about the structure of the graph or purpose of the visualization.
These notes describe a few of the situations that arise most
frequently in practice.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When there is no additional structure / specific purpose, a
reasonable default for node-link diagrams uses force-directed
layout. In this layout, we think of nodes as particles that want to
repel one another, but which are tied together by elastic edges. In
ggraph, this can be specified by the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">force</code> layout.</p>

    <p>In D3, we can use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">d3.force()</code> function. This animates the
physical system as it settles into an equilibrium state. These can
be visually attractive, but be careful when using this, since the
animation serves no specific visual purpose.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One common situation where we can go beyond force-directed graphs is
when we have additional information about the nodes that can be used
to constrain their position. For example, the Royal Constellations
visualization, attempts to visualize the family trees of royal
families. On the y-axis, the nodes are constrained to be sorted by
year, and across the x-axis, nodes are constrained according to the
country of the royal family.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More generally, we can define x and y-axis constraints and then use
a force-directed algorithm to layout the nodes, subject to those
constraints. These can be easily implemented by combining D3 with
the cola library.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The key line in the example above is
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.constraints(graph.constraints)</code>. This takes a dictionary of pixel
constraints between pairs of nodes; e.g.,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{"axis":"y", "left":0, "right":1, "gap":25}</code> says that node 1
should be (at least) 25 pixels above node 0.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another common situation is that the nodes can be organized into a
hierarchy of subgraphs. That is, nodes can be partitioned into
non-overlapping sets. These sets can themselves be merged together
to define a coarser partition.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This hierarchical structure can be encoded in either node-link or
adjacency matrix visualizations. For example, in node-link views, we
can draw shapes enclosing the sets,</p>

    <p>and in adjacency matrices, we can draw trees specifying the
hierarchy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can in fact use the cola library to encode hierarchy in node-link
views. The example below uses cola to ensure sets don’t overlap. It
then draws (and fills in) paths that contain the separate sets.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In some graphs, we have clustering structure. Within each cluster,
nodes are densely connected, but between clusters, there are only a
few links. In this case, it’s natural to use adjacency matrices to
visualize the clusters and then draw links for connections between
adjacency matrices. The reasoning is that adjacency matrices are
better suited in densely connected graphs (they don’t have the edge
crossing problem) but node-link encodings are better when we want to
follow longer paths across clusters.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is just one example of a larger class of “hybrid” matrix
encodings. It’s possible to solve a variety of visual problems, just
by cleverly combining the elementary visual encodings discussed last
week.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far, we have focused on high-level properties of the graph that
can be accounted for in visualization. Sometimes, the intended
function of the visualization warrants thinking at a low-level
instead. For example, in many problems, we are interested in
studying ego-networks — the small neighborhoods that surround
specific nodes of interest.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One example of a layout that was designed to support ego-network
visualization is the egoCompare system. This is a kind of overview +
detail graph visualization where users can select pairs of nodes to
compare within an overview graph. The 2-nearest-neighbor graphs for
each of these selected nodes are then shown (and linked together, if
applicable). The subgraphs are arranged in a way that minimizes the
amount of crossing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The last type of graph we’ll consider in these notes are dynamic
graphs. These are graphs where the sets of nodes and links are
evolving over time. For example, the interactions between proteins
in a protein interaction network may change when a cell is exposed
to environmental stress, like the presence of a virus.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no single way to visualize these networks, but common
strategies include use of animation, faceting over time, combined
encodings (like time series within nodes), or coordinated views.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these notes, we’ve see some academic literature on visualization.
Even for those of us who are more practically oriented, this
literature can be worth being familiar, if only because it can be a
treasure trove of visual problem solving devices.</p>
  </li>
