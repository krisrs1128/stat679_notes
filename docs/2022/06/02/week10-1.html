  <li>
    <p>Graph layouts can often benefit from additional information known
about the structure of the graph or purpose of the visualization.
These notes describe a few of the situations that arise most
frequently in practice.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When there is no additional structure / specific purpose, a
reasonable default for node-link diagrams uses force-directed
layout, as discussed previously. In this layout, we think of nodes
as particles that want to repel one another, but which are tied
together by elastic edges.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One common situation where we can go beyond force-directed graphs is
when we have additional information about the nodes that can be used
to constrain their position. For example, the Royal Constellations
visualization, attempts to visualize the family trees of royal
families. On the y-axis, the nodes are constrained to be sorted by
year, and across the x-axis, nodes are constrained according to the
country of the royal family.</p>

    <iframe src="https://royalconstellations.visualcinnamon.com/" width="800" height="500"></iframe>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More generally, we can define x and y-axis constraints and then use
a force-directed algorithm to layout the nodes, subject to those
constraints. These can be implemented by combining D3 with the <a href="https://ialab.it.monash.edu/webcola/">cola
library</a>. For example, we’ve
simulated data that are known to fall into three tight clusters, but
using a naive force-directed layout leads to clusters that cross one
another.</p>

    <iframe src="https://krisrs1128.github.io/stat679_code/examples/week10/week10-1/cola-example.html" data-external="1" height="400" width="500"></iframe>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To resolve this, we can explicitly tell the layout algorithm to
constrain the x-coordinates for nodes within each cluster.</p>

    <iframe src="https://krisrs1128.github.io/stat679_code/examples/week10/week10-1/cola-example-2.html" data-external="1" height="400" width="500"></iframe>

    <p>To accomplish this, we defined an array of objects specifying pixel
constraints between pairs of nodes; e.g.,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{"axis":"y", "left":0, "right":1,  "gap":25}</code> says that node 1
should be (at least) 25 pixels above node 0.</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>let constrained = cola.d3adaptor()
  .nodes(nodes)
  .links(links)
  .constraints(constraints)
  .groups(groups)
  .start()
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another common situation is that the nodes can be organized into a
hierarchy of subgraphs. That is, nodes can be partitioned into
non-overlapping sets. These sets can themselves be merged together
to define a coarser partition.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This hierarchical structure can be encoded in either node-link or
adjacency matrix visualizations. For example, in node-link views, we
can draw shapes enclosing the sets,</p>

    <p><img src="/stat679_notes/assets/week10-1/graph-hierarchy.png" width="350" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>

    <p>and in adjacency matrices, we can draw trees specifying the
hierarchy.</p>

    <p><img src="/stat679_notes/assets/week10-1/matlink.png" width="200" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
Here is an example implementation, again using <a href="https://ialab.it.monash.edu/webcola/examples/smallgroups.html">the Cola
library</a>.
Notice how nodes across groups always remain separated from one
another.</p>

    <iframe src="https://ialab.it.monash.edu/webcola/examples/smallgroups.html" data-external="1" height="350" width="700"></iframe>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here is a simplified implementation that draws a boundary around
groups of nodes without the help of the cola library. In addition to
drawing nodes and links, it adds (and fills in) paths that contain
the separate sets.</p>

    <iframe src="https://krisrs1128.github.io/stat679_code/examples/week10/week10-1/miserables-group.html" data-external="1" height="400" width="500"></iframe>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Specifically, each time the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">d3.force()</code> simulation ticks, it
calculates the convex hull of the set of nodes within each group
using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">convex_hull()</code>, which is a light wrapper we have prepared
around the existing <a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-polygonhull"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">d3.polygonHull</code>
function</a>. This returns
an array of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y</code> coordinates for the group boundary. This is
then use to draw a path that loops in on itself. We fill in the
loops according to which group number it corresponds to.</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>d3.select("#hulls")
  .selectAll("path")
  .data(convex_hull(nodes))
  .attrs({
    d: path_generator,
    fill: (d, i) =&gt; scales.fill(i)
  })
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In some graphs, we have clustering structure. Within each cluster,
nodes are densely connected, but between clusters, there are only a
few links. In this case, it’s natural to use adjacency matrices to
visualize the clusters and then draw links for connections between
adjacency matrices. The reasoning is that adjacency matrices are
better suited in densely connected graphs (they don’t have the edge
crossing problem) but node-link encodings are better when we want to
follow longer paths across clusters. Below, I’ve included a
screenshot from the paper that introduced this layout approach,</p>

    <p><img src="/stat679_notes/assets/week10-1/NodeTrix.png" width="767" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>

    <p>Though it would be a nontrivial implementation, I hope you can at
least get a rough idea about how we could begin to implement
something like this using D3. We already know how to draw adjacency
matrices as collections of appended rectangles. We could imagine
appending each of these rectangles to separate group elements. If we
knew the links between groups, we could run a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">d3.force()</code>
simulation to arrange groups in a nice layout. We could then append
lines between the groups (or, if we want to more completely emulate
the smooth links of figure, we could try a kind of <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/main/README.md">curve or link
generator</a>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is just one example of a larger class of “hybrid” matrix
encodings. It’s possible to solve a variety of visual problems, just
by cleverly combining the elementary visual encodings discussed last
week.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far, we have focused on high-level properties of the graph that
can be accounted for in visualization. Sometimes, the intended
function of the visualization warrants thinking at a low-level
instead. For example, in many problems, we are interested in
studying ego-networks — the small neighborhoods that surround
specific nodes of interest.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One example of a layout that was designed to support ego-network
visualization is the egoCompare system. This is a kind of overview +
detail graph visualization where users can select pairs of nodes to
compare within an overview graph. The 2-nearest-neighbor graphs for
each of these selected nodes are then shown (and linked together, if
applicable). The subgraphs are arranged in a way that minimizes the
amount of crossing.</p>

    <p><img src="/stat679_notes/assets/week10-1/ego_compare.jpeg" width="1907" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The last type of graph we’ll consider in these notes are dynamic
graphs. These are graphs where the sets of nodes and links are
evolving over time. For example, the interactions between proteins
in a protein interaction network may change when a cell is exposed
to environmental stress, like the presence of a virus. There is no
single way to visualize these networks, but common strategies
include use of animation, faceting over time, combined encodings
(like time series within nodes), or dynamic linking between
coordinated views.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, here is an animated view of conflicts between countries
over time,</p>

    <iframe width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0" src="https://observablehq.com/embed/@yaslena/dynamic-network-graph?cells=viewof+time%2Cchart"></iframe>

    <p>and here is a combined encoding of time series arranged along a
graph, from the pathvis paper.</p>

    <p><img src="/stat679_notes/assets/week10-1/pathvis.png" width="350" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these notes, we’ve see some academic literature on visualization.
Even if you are more practically oriented, this literature can be
worth being familiar, if only because it can be a treasure trove of
visual problem solving devices.</p>
