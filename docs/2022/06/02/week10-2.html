      <p><em>View interaction in graphs</em></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Interactivity makes it possible to tinker with different views of a
graph and get immediate feedback. By exploring a sequence of these
views, it can be possible to build up a holistic understand of even
very complex graphs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s helpful to think of graph interaction as falling into three
categories, though the boundaries can often be fuzzy. From most
superficial to most substantive, these are,</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> * View interactivity: For a fixed mapping from data to visual marks, we alter
 the user’s view so that different regions become easier to study.
 * Encoding interactivity: We can change the visual encodings of a fixed
 collection of data based on user queries.
 * Data interactivity: We can allow the user to manipulate the data that appear
 in any given graph.
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>In these notes, we’ll consider a few examples of view interactivity.
Later, we’ll discuss encoding and data interactivity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A simple form of view interactivity is panning and zooming.
Together, they can be used to change the center and extent of the
user’s field of view. Even though these operations don’t require any
complex redrawing of the graph, they allow a simple form of
overview + detail interactivity. We can zoom out to view the overall
graph and then pan and zoom to specific neighborhoods of interest.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In D3, panning and zooming can be implemented using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">d3.drag()</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">d3.zoom()</code>, respectively. These are used to construct functions
that can then be called on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">g</code> elements containing the objects to
pan and zoom over. For example, to pan and zoom over a simple set of
circles, we can use this block,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Application to the graph context works similarly. Here is an example
where we can pan and zoom across a node-link diagram (can you think
of how to do this for an adjacency matrix view?)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are more subtle forms of view interactivity. One interesting
example discussed in the reading for this week is “edge lensing.”
This type of interaction is designed to solve the problem of highly
overlapping edges in dense regions of the graph. For example,
suppose we want to identify the neighbors of a node that lies in the
core of the graph. Since it lies in a dense region, there is a good
chance that many links cross over it, even if they are not direct
neighbors.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The idea of the edge lens interaction is to create a “lens” that
hides edges that are not directly relevant to the queried region.
For example, this removes long-range interactions between nodes far
from the lens.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can implement a simple version of this in D3. We can easily draw
a lens by asking a circle to follow our mouse using a mousemove
interaction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Next, we find all the nodes that are contained within the lens. In
the updated view, we redraw edges for these nodes, and we make sure
they lie above the lens.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not the most efficient implementation, since we draw the
edges within the lens twice (both above and below the lens). In
principle, we could compute the edge / lens intersections and change
the line endpoints as we move. However, the resulting code would be
harder for a new reader to understand, and except in the most
compute-constrained environments, we should prefer readable
implementations (this is in the spirit of “premature optimization is
the root of all evil”).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are a few other forms of lens-based view interactions. A
variant of edge lenses brings all of a node’s neighbors into the
currently hovered view. Fisheye lens are used to distort the view so
that the lensed area gets expanded. The user’s past history of
inputs can be used to define an “interest” function over regions of
the graph, and areas considered more interesting can be expanded to
take up more space in the layout.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>None of these approaches directly change the graph data (Data
Interactivity) or their encodings (Encoding Interactivity). In the
next set of notes, we’ll consider these more substantive
interactions.</p>
  </li>
