<ol>
  <li>
    <p>In these notes, we continue our tour of static time series
visualization techniques, with a special emphasis on collections of
time series.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our first more advanced method is called the horizon plot. Below,
I’ve created a horizon plot of the Australian tourism data, along
with the line plot we made last time for comparison.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This figure isn’t yet standard, so let’s walk through how to read
it. We’ve taken the explanation below from the <a href="https://flowingdata.com/2015/07/02/changing-price-of-food-items-and-horizon-graphs/">FlowingData
blog</a>.
The main idea is to split the time series into a few horizontal
bands, each of which will be assigned to a separate color. A special
dividing line (the horizon line) is used to split between two colors
in a diverging color scheme.</p>

    <p><img src="https://github.com/krisrs1128/stat679_notes/blob/main/assets/week7-2/horizon.png?raw=true" width="500" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once the bands are defined, the components are all collapsed on top
of one another. In this way, even though there may be a large range
in the realized y-values, the amount of space needed to display them
all is relatively small. We’re able to decide which overall band we
are in (and hence the overall value of y) based on color.</p>

    <p><img src="/stat679_notes/assets/week7-2/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" alt="" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We created the figure above using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ggHoriPlot</code> package. We have
to specify both the horizon line (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">origin</code>) and the cutoffs that
separate the bands (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">horizonscales</code>). The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">..Cutpoints..</code> term
creates the color legend.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overall, the horizon plot gives a reasonable compromise between
faceting and heatmaps — it preserves some of the advantages of using
y-position to encode value while having some of the compactness of
heatmaps. The advantages of taking this middle ground has been
documented in research. However, the approach is not very intuitive,
and for a general audience, we typically will have to explain how to
read these figures.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What if we are interested more in totals and composition (i.e.,
values divided by total) across a collection? A few approaches make
it especially easy to answer these types of queries.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To illustrate, we’ll consider the X-men appearances dataset. This
includes the number of times each character appeared on the page
across all the issues of the comic (as well as whether they were
dressed normally or as superheroes during each appearance). We’ve
filtered down to just the most common characters, to make comparison
easier.</p>

  <li>
    <p>One way to visualize how the total number and composition of
character appearances change over issues is to use a stacked area
plot. This is the analog of an area plot, but where multiple areas
are stacked on top of one another.</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># custom color palette
pal &lt;- c(
  "#8E038E", lighten("#8E038E", .2, space = "HLS"),
  "#C20008", lighten("#C20008", .2, space = "HLS"),
  "#13AFEF", lighten("#13AFEF", .25, space = "HLS"),
  "#595A52", lighten("#595A52", .15, space = "HLS"),
  "#FFB400", lighten("#FFB400", .25, space = "HLS")
)

ggplot(xmen) +
  geom_area(aes(issue, depicted, col = interaction(costume, char_popular), fill = interaction(costume, char_popular))) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = pal) +
  scale_color_manual(values = pal) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0, 0.1, 0)) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p><img src="/stat679_notes/assets/week7-2/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" alt="" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An alternative is the stream graph (also sometimes called “Theme
River”). It is like a stacked area chart, but oriented around a
central (rather than base) line. These are also almost always
smoothed slightly, so that the transitions are not too jarring.</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ggplot(xmen) +
  geom_stream(aes(issue, depicted, col = interaction(costume, char_popular), fill = interaction(costume, char_popular)), bw = 0.4) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = pal) +
  scale_color_manual(values = pal) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p><img src="/stat679_notes/assets/week7-2/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" alt="" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been some controversy about whether approaches like
streamgraphs are actually more effective than area plots. Broadly
speaking, one camp focuses on functionality, evaluating approaches
by user experiments on formal tasks. Another allows aesthetic appeal
to factor into decision-making. It’s not necessary to take up any
particular position in this course, but it’s good when speaking with
others in the visualization community to know that these positions
exist (and that your designs might elicit certain reactions).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even though both stacked area and stream graphs make it easier to
tell how the totals at any timepoint breakdown across groups, they
don’t necessarily make it easy to rank the groups by their relative
contribution (groups with similar contributions might be hard to
rank).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, consider the dataset below, which describes the number
of refugees leaving countries around the world between 2000
and 2010. The stacked area graph shows that there was a clear
increase in refugees from Iraq starting in 2004, but it’s unclear
whether this overtook Afghanistan.</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>refugees &lt;- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krisrs1128/stat679_code/main/examples/week7/week7-1/refugees.csv")
ggplot(refugees) +
  geom_stream(aes(year, refugees, fill = country), bw = 1) +
  facet_wrap(~ region, scale = "free_y")
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p><img src="/stat679_notes/assets/week7-2/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" alt="" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we want to explicitly rank the groups, we can use an alluvial
plot. It is a hybrid between a bump chart and streamgraph. It is
read like a stream graph, but at each timepoint, the groups are
sorted from largest to smallest contribution. Applying it to the
dataset above shows that Iraq did indeed become the largest source
of refugees within the Mideast starting around 2004.</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ggplot(refugees) +
  geom_alluvium(aes(year, refugees, fill = country, alluvium = country), decreasing = FALSE, alpha = 0.9) +
  facet_wrap(~ region, scale = "free_y") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_number(scale_cut = cut_long_scale()))
</code></pre></div>    </div>
