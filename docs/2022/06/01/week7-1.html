<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Time often has a special role in data analysis. In the next few
notes, we’ll study some of the types of time-related questions that
can be answered through visualization. We’ll also tour some familiar
(as well as some more obscure) visualizations strategies.
Throughout, we’ll restrict attention to static views — next week,
we’ll consider some interactive approaches to understanding temporal
data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we get into the details, there is no single type of time series
visualization — all designs should be tailored to the specifics of
both the data and the purpose at hand. For example, the data can
vary across these characteristics,</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Is there one series of interest? Or are there multiple series
moving together?</li>
      <li>How is time recorded? Is it qualitative (e.g., early, middle,
late) or quantitative (specific hour timestamp)?</li>
      <li>What types of variables are measured at each timepoint? E.g.,
are they categorical, quantitative, geographic?</li>
      <li>Are the data measured at regular temporal frequencies, or is it
available on an unevenly spaced grid?</li>
      <li>Are the data expected to include strong cyclic or seasonal
patterns?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to variation across datasets, there is variation across
tasks. The most basic questions are direct lookups,</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Identification: Given a timepoint of interest, what was the
value of some variable?</li>
      <li>Localization: Given the value of some variable, which timepoints
achieved it?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of a direct lookup, we may instead be interested in
comparison. This can include comparison of multiple variables at a
fixed timepoint or comparison of multiple timepoints / ranges for a
fixed variable. Further, we might be interested in more than queries
for specific values, we might want a “synoptic” view of the time
series, looking for higher-level trends or patterns that aren’t
visible when restricting attention to any narrow range of timepoints
or variable values.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, there have been several efforts to systematically
taxonomize the types of queries that time series visualizations have
been used for, like the example from this week’s reading,</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>It can be useful to have this theory in mind, if only because it
helps clarify the wide range of design decisions that are implicitly
made anytime we make a time series visualization. An approach that
streamlines one type of lookup / comparison might come at the cost
of another, and it’s helpful to have language to express the
trade-offs involved.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That said, this will be enough theory for now. Let’s make some
plots. First, we begin with the simple line plot. A notable aspect
of this approach is that it highlights change. Our eyes immediately
pick up the steepness, shallowness, or roughness of different parts
of the curve.</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>library(tsibble)
library(tsibbledata)
library(tidyverse)

theme679 &lt;- theme_bw() +
  theme(
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#f7f7f7"),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()
  )
theme_set(theme679)
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, in the figure below, we’re showing the amount of trade
in Canadian Lynx pelts near the beginning of the 20th century. We
can immediately recognize the seasonal structure.</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ggplot(pelt) +
  geom_line(aes(Year, Lynx)) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 1))
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p><img src="/stat679_notes/assets/week7-1/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" alt="" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We made this figure using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">geom_line</code> geometry in ggplot2. The
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y</code> arguments are used to encode time and trade volume,
respectively. Alternatively, we can emphasize the fact that these
are amounts (they must be nonnegative) by drawing this as an area
plot. This uses the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">geom_area</code> mark.</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ggplot(pelt) +
  geom_area(aes(Year, Lynx)) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0, 0.1, 0)) 
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p><img src="/stat679_notes/assets/week7-1/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" alt="" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What if we had a larger collection of time series? For example, the
dataset below includes the number of tourists in different states in
Australia, measured quarterly. We are interested in questions like,
which destinations are more popular, and when? Have there been
periods when one (or several) regions were especially popular /
avoided? Is there any strong seasonal structure or are there (upward
or downward) trends?</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># filter to most popular regions
data(tourism)
tourism &lt;- tourism %&gt;%
  filter(Purpose == "Holiday")

region_totals &lt;- tourism %&gt;%
  as_tibble() %&gt;%
  group_by(Region) %&gt;%
  summarise(total_trips = sum(Trips)) %&gt;%
  arrange(-total_trips)

filter_regions &lt;- function(x, K = 6) {
  x %&gt;%
    filter(Region %in% region_totals$Region[1:K])
}

ggplot(filter_regions(tourism)) +
  geom_line(aes(Quarter, Trips, col = Region))
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p><img src="/stat679_notes/assets/week7-1/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" alt="" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To approach these questions, we can try some simple modifications of
the lineplot. A first attempt is to include all the lines in one
frame, with color used to distinguish each state. The result is
almost impossible to read, though.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Aside: If we hadn’t included color in our mapping, the figure
would look like this. This happens because each timepoint has
multiple y-values. To tell ggplot2 to create separate lines for
each state, we have to use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">group</code> argument.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- -->

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ggplot(filter_regions(tourism)) +
  geom_line(aes(Quarter, Trips))
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p><img src="/stat679_notes/assets/week7-1/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" alt="" /></p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ggplot(filter_regions(tourism)) +
  geom_line(aes(Quarter, Trips, group = Region))
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p><img src="/stat679_notes/assets/week7-1/unnamed-chunk-6-2.png" alt="" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another variation on the line plot is to use faceting. This works
better, but can take up quite a bit of space when there are many
regions. Another downside of this approach is that it’s hard to
exactly compare the y-values for pairs of series, since they no are
no longer overlapping. Also, as soon as we have to start scrolling
up and down to compare different states, the value of the small
multiples starts dropping.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<!-- -->

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ggplot(filter_regions(tourism, 20)) +
  geom_line(aes(Quarter, Trips)) +
  facet_wrap(~ reorder(Region, -Trips))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="/stat679_notes/assets/week7-1/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>To address this, we could consider dropping line plots entirely. The
approach below uses a heatmap, with each state on its own line. This
approach is very compact and relatively accessible, but we no longer
see trends so clearly: differences in color are harder to evaluate
than differences in y-position.</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ggplot(filter_regions(tourism, 18)) +
  geom_tile(aes(Quarter, reorder(Region, Trips), fill = Trips, col = Trips)) +
  scale_fill_distiller(direction = 1) +
  scale_x_yearquarter(expand = c(0, 0)) +
  scale_y_discrete(expand = c(0, 0)) +
  scale_color_distiller(direction = 1)
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p><img src="/stat679_notes/assets/week7-1/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" alt="" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We made this using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">geom_tile</code> layer. Notice that we gave values
for both the fill and color arguments — without color, there would
be small gaps along the borders of each tile. Also, we reordered the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Region</code> column so that rows were sorted from those with the most to
the least tourism.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These notes have reviewed the more familiar approaches to time
series visualization. In the next lecture, we’ll consider some more
obscure (but often useful) approaches.</p>
