      <p><em>What are typical queries for graph data?</em></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Graphs are common across a wide range of fields — for example,
biochemistry (metabolic networks), sociology (friendship networks),
digital humanities (letter-writing networks), evolution
(phylogenetic trees), transportation (logistical routing),
gastronomy (recipe networks) and cybersecurity (inter-computer
communication). In each of these fields, it’s common to try to
visualize the network. But why is visualization ever useful in this
context? We’ll explore a few answers in these notes, along with some
criteria that can be used to evaluate the quality of a graph
visualization.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Viewed narrowly, there are two basic types of queries for graph
data: Topological and attributional. In topological queries, we ask
questions about how nodes are linked with one another. For example,
is node A within three steps of node B? On the other hand,
attributional queries are related to the attributes associated with
nodes and edges. For example, which nodes (or edges) have an
attribute value above X?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More broadly, we often visualize graphs with the goal of developing
a more holistic view. There may be salient global or local
structures of interest — for example, we may discover the existence
of,</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Clusters: Nodes that are tightly linked with one another, but
not with nodes outside of the cluster.</li>
      <li>Hubs: Nodes with many more neighbors than others.</li>
      <li>Central nodes: Nodes that lie on the shortest paths between many
pairs of nodes.</li>
      <li>Connections: Links between nodes or clusters of interest. though
there are probably more than is reasonable to list.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What distinguishes a good from a bad graph visualization? As in all
data visualization, effectiveness is closely tied to function. The
representation / interaction should make sure information needed to
support the intended task is easily accessible, and that superfluous
information does not occupy too much of the reader’s attention.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, if a visualization has too many edge crossings, then we
will have trouble answering any topological queries — crossings can
make it impossible to follow edges.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As an alternative, consider either edge bundling or adjacency matrix
views. Both highlight the key connectivity structure and minimize
the overlap that comes with more naive visualizations.</p>

    <p>[Example with edge bundling and adjacencies] We’ll see how to make
both types of visualizations in later lectures.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In interactive graphs, we should aim to minimize the amount of
change in the positions of the nodes and edges given any user input
— too much movement creates confusion. The same lesson applies to
dynamic graphs. It is hard to make sense of an evolving graph if the
same nodes and edges are unnecessarily jumping around.</p>
  </li>
