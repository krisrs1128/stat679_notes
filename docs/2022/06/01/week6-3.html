  <li>
    <p>In the same way that time plays a central role in analysis of time series datasets, space / location is often a central element in geographic data visualization. Indeed, these two types of visualization have much longer histories than even the simple scatterplot (which only emerged in the 19th century, as the abstract analog of map).</p>
  </li>
  <li>There are two types of geographic data worth distinguishing between — vector and raster data.
    <ul>
      <li>Vector data formats are used to store geometric information, like the locations of hospitals (points), trajectories of bus routes (lines), or boundaries of counties (polygons). It’s useful to think of the associated data as being spatially enriched data frames, with each row corresponding to one of these geometric features. Vector data are usually stored in .geojson, .wkt, .shp, or .topojson formats.</li>
      <li>Raster data give a measurement along a spatial grid. You can think of them as spatially enriched matrices, where the metadata says where on the earth each entry of the matrix is associated with. Raster data are often stored in tiff format.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are three packages that are especially useful for working with spatial data in R. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sf</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">terra</code> are designed to support manipulation of vector and raster data, respectively. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tmap</code> is a visualization package applicable to either format (or even combinations of them).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let’s look at some vector data. The examples below read in a road network from Rio de Janeiro, polygons of glacier boundaries in Nepal, and locations of hospitals in Madison. Notice that each row is georeferenced (try searching the lat / lon coordinates online, like this).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tmap</code> to visualize each of these datasets. The logic of the package mirrors that of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ggplot2</code>, we use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tmap_shape</code> to tell the package our source data, and then we can add on layers that add visual marks based on it. For example, to draw the road network, we use add on a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tmap_line</code> layer. For the glaciers and hospitals, we can use the analogous fill and point layers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Remember that each element of a vector dataset can be thought of as a row of a data.frame (just with added georeferencing information). This means that it is often possible to encode features of each element using properties of the marks used to represent them. For example, we’ve shaded in each of the glaciers by their thickness, which shows that the larger and more central ones tend to be thicker.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These kinds of fill-encoded polygon visualizations are sometimes called choropleths. You have almost surely seen these before. For example, here are vote percentages across census tracts in the united states.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What about raster data? We can again use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tmap</code>, but we have to use different types of layers. For example, the data read in below come from the Sentinel 2 satellite, an open (and continually updated) collection of satellite images maintained by the European Space Agency. They give imagery associated with one small subset of the glaciers labels. To visualize just one image channel from this data, we can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tmap_raster</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many raster datasets have more than just one channel (our Sentinel dataset has 13). We can plot combinations of them using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tmap_rgb</code>. For example, channels 2 - 4 correspond to the usual RGB channels that appear in ordinary camera images.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all the discussion above, we’ve worked with the original spatial data that were given to us. In practice, we will often want to manipulate these data before making a final visualization — for example, we may want to crop to a specific region of interest or unify sources from a few neighboring regions. These types of operations are the bread and butter of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sf</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">terra</code>. For example, if we want to crop the glacier labels down to the region contained by the satellite image, we can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sf</code>’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">st_crop</code> command.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can also zoom into the raster data using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">terra</code>’s crop function. We crop both datasets again to get a high-resolution view of this region.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tmap</code> provides many functions for customizing the appearance of our maps. For example, there are layers for adding specific cartographic elements, like bar scales (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tmap_bar</code>) and compasses (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tmap_compass</code>).</p>

    <p>Moreover, the themes and layout of the existing layers can be adapted using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tmap_layout</code> function. In the example below, we’ve moved the legend so that they don’t overlap with the observed shapefiles. We’ve also changed the color palette so that the glaciers are more clearly visible.</p>
  </li>
